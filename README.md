# DoraHacks NKN Chat Client

The blockchain community is creating decentralized solutions for all
kinds of problems, but we mostly chat on centralized platforms like
Telegram.

[NKN](https://nkn.org/) is producing a blockchain technology aimed at
communication.  This blockchian has public addresses, similar to a
Bitcoin or ETH wallet address, that can be used to send messages.

This repo contains a web client for a chat system built on top of the
NKN blockchain. We also have an Electron-based client (which is also a
chatbot) and an iOS-based client.
